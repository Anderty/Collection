Archibalds Castle v1.3:

This Mod adds 10 modular buildable parts of a castle into the game (2 main-buildings and 8 side-buildings), unlocked at 750 investors. The castle mainly consists of buildings from Archibald Blake (3rd Party) and some parts of other buldings.

Explanation: You got the choice! Do you want a straight castle but with an offset between the individual modules (choose straight) OR a crooked castle but with smooth connections between the modules (choose smooth)

After you installed the mod, you can find the castle at the building-menu of investors (castle icon).

Just push Shift + v for choosing between the individual main-buildings (left icon) or side-buildings (right icon).

  - All buildings of the castle does have lights now

  - some small changes at behavior of feedback-pedestrians

  Bugfixes:
  
  - some flaws of the main-building with the 3 towers have been revised
